Four kids get detention after school and as their punishment they are supposed
to clean up the attic..
then Franklin Finbar (Anthony) found a video game and asked Bravestone (Spencer)
what it is..
spencer wanted to see if it will still work so they attach the cable and then
a screen comes letting  them choose their characters
